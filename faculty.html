The creation of the School was in response to the concern of the Federal Government and the directive of the National Universities Commission (NUC) on the need to produce graduates with the academic and professional skills that promote self employment and reduce over dependence on paid employment. This concern is predicated on the high level of unemployment among graduates and the over-dependence on paid employment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;"><span>The school commenced academic activities with staff and students transferred from related disciplines, particularly from the School of Environmental Technology of the University. As a fast growing University of Technology, where modern courses in Technology, Engineering and ICT have been established, that is located in a rapidly expanding city, with close proximity to Abuja, Kaduna, and other cities, FUT Minna is an ideal location for such school.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;"><span>The school is built on the following Philosophy, Vision and Mission:</span></p><br>
