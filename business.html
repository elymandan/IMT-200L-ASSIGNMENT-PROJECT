<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; text-align: justify;">Suffice to say that, entrepreneurship is the process of creating values by bring together a unique of resources to exploit opportunities for social and commercial purpose it is not synonymous to being a business man, trader, self-employed, small scale business owners or vocational skills acquisition. Thus it is obvious that not all business people are entrepreneurs but the knowledge of business is essential for effective entrepreneurship. Most of our student, fresh from the secondary schools need basic skills to demonstrate the entrepreneurial behavior hence the introduction of vocational clubs to enhance skills acquisition.
